        <li>Cannellini Beans</li>

        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Halve, peel, and finely chop half the onion (save rest for another use). Peel and finely chop carrot. Mince or grate garlic. Remove ribs and stems from kale and discard. Coarsely chop leaves. Drain and rinse cannellini beans.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 TBSP olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, carrot, fennel seeds, garlic, and as much of the chili flakes as you like. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until veggies have softened, for 5-6 minutes, tossing occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add and cook Sausage</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, cannellini beans, stock concentrate, and 3 cups water to pot and stir. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then lower heat and reduce to a simmer. Cook until veggies are very tender, 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While soup simmers, halve ciabatta horizontally. Drizzle cut sides with olive oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. Place ciabatta on a baking sheet and toast until cheese is melted and edges are golden, 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add kale to pot and cover. Cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cut Ciabatta into cubes. Pour soup into bowls and top with ciabatta cubes.</li>
    </ol>
